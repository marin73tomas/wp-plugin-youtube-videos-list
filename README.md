# wp-plugin-youtube-videos-list
A custom plugin that display a list of videos in the frontend and store them in custom post types.

Everything works. However the Youtube API does not show any list of categories from a video ID. I have tried many ways with many videos and nothing shows up. My URL request is correct so it must be a Youtube error.
However I have left a code that will create only unduplicated categories from the Youtube IP by video ID.
